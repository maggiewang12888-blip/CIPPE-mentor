    "explanation": "《欧洲人权公约》第8条保护私人和家庭生活、住宅和通信受到尊重的权利。然而，这项 权利并不是绝对的，公共当局可以根据法律并出于合法目的对其进行限制。欧洲人权法院\n(ECHR) 制定了一项丙阶段测试，以确定此类限制是否合理。首先，法院必须审查公共 当局所追求的合法目的，例如国家安全、公共安全或预防犯罪。其次，法院必须评估公共 当局为实现这一目标而使用的手段是否适当和必要。这一目标，同时考虑到所有相关因素， 例如相称性、必要性和限制性较小的替代方案。因此，隐私权不是一项绝对权利，而是一 项有条件的权利，必须与《欧洲人权公约》规定的其他权利相平衡。",

Although no one was hurt, Louis has been plagued by texts and calls from a company called Accidentable offering to help him recover compensation for personal injury. Louis has heard about insurance companies selling customers'data to third parties, and he's convinced that Accidentable must have gotten his information from Bedrock Insurance.\nLouis has also been receiving an increased amount of marketing information from Bedrock, trying to sell him their full range of their insurance policies.\nPerturbed by this, Louis has started looking at price comparison sites on the internet and has been shocked to find that other insurers offer much cheaper rates than Bedrock, eventhough he has been a loyal customer for many years. When his Bedrock policy comes up for renewal, he decides to switch to Zantrum Insurance.\nIn order to activate his new insurance policy, Louis needs to supply Zantrum with information about his No Claims bonus, his vehicle and his driving history. After researching his rights under the GDPR, he writes to ask Bedrock to transfer his information directly to Zantrum. He also takes this opportunity to ask Bedrock to stop using his personal data for marketing purposes.\nBedrock supplies Louis with a PDF and XML(Extensible Markup Language) versions of his No Claims Certificate, but tells Louis it cannot transfer his data directly to Zantrum as this is not technically feasible. Bedrock also explains that Louis's contract included a provision whereby Louis agreed that his data could be used for marketing purposes;according to Bedrock, it is too late for Louis to change his mind about this.

He warns Accidentable that he plans to complain to the data protection authority, because he thinks their company has been using his data unlawfully.

After doing some research, he meets with a sales representative from the up-and-coming IT company Techiva, hoping that they can design a new, cutting-edge website for TripBliss Inc.'s foundering business.\nDuring negotiations, a Techiva representative describes a plan for gathering more customer information through detailed questionnaires, which could be used to tailor their preferences to specific travel destinations. TripBliss Inc.can choose any number of data categories-age, income, ethnicity-that would help them best accomplish their goals. Oliver loves this idea, but would also like to have some way of gauging how successful this approach is, especially since the questionnaires will require customers to provide explicit consent to having their data collected. The Techiva representative suggests that they also run a program to analyze the new website's traffic, in order to get a better understanding of how customers are using it. He explains his plan to place a number of cookies on customer devices. The cookies will allow the company to collect IPaddresses and other information, such as the sites from which the customers came, how much time they spend on the TripBliss Inc.website, and which pages on the site they visit.

To help with this, Mary identified two vendors, HRYourWay, a German based company, and InstaHR, an Australian based company. She decided to have both vendors go through ProStorage's vendor risk review process so she can work with Ruth to make the final decision. As part of the review process, Jackie, who is responsible for maintaining ProStorage's privacy program(including maintaining controller BCRs and conducting vendor risk assessments) reviewed both vendors but completed a transfer impact assessment only for InstaHR. After her review of both vendors, she determined that InstaHR satisfied more of the requirements as it boasted a more established privacy program and provided third-party attestations, whereas HRYourWay was a small vendor with minimal data protection operations. Thus, she recommended InstaHR. ProStorage's marketing team also worked to meet the strategic goals of the company by focusing on industries where it needed to grow its market share.

    "explanation": "依据这个情境，InstaHR是一家澳大利亚的公司，而且假如我们推测ProStorage的数据将从 欧洲的地区转移到澳大利亚，那么合适的转移机制应该是标准合约条款。这是因为，到目 前为止，欧盟并没有认定澳大利亚为拥有“充分”数据保护的国家，所以不能采用“充分性” 作为转移机制。同时，绑定企业规则通常适用于同一企业集团内部的全球数据转移，而在 此场景中InstaHR和ProStorage不是同一企业集团的公司。而员工明确的同意虽然是一种可 能的转移机制，但是其在实践中通常只被视为是一种最后的选择，因为获得有效的明确同 意通常是一个复杂且具有挑战性的过程。因此，在这种情况下，标准合约条款可能会是最 好的选择。",

Ronan tells the CEO that:(a) the potential risks of such activities means that Dynaroux needs to carry out a data protection impact assessment to assess this new venture and its privacy implications;and (b) where the results of this assessment indicate a high risk in the absence of appropriate protection measures, Dynaroux may have to\nundertake a prior consultation with the Irish Data Protection Commissioner before implementing the app and loyalty scheme.\nJonas tells Ronan that he is not happy about the prospect of having to directly engage with a supervisory authority and having to disclose details of Dynaroux's business plan and associated processing activities.",

    "explanation": "补充：原答案为D，但是根据人工智能法案（如果涉足“禁止”领域，则被处以3500万欧元或全球年销售总额7%的罚款，以二者之中的更高金额为准进行处罚。如果没有履行除“禁止”以外的其他风险分类中的义务，则根据业务规模等处以1500万欧元或最高不超过全球年销售总额3%的罚款。），本题无正确答案。 建议：如果考试中选项更正了，则按照人工智能法案规定直接选择；如仍为这些选项，从应对考试拿分的角度，建议仍然选择D（6%的这个答案）。",
